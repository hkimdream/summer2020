#### Work done
I started looking over the Sage project and its architecture
Notes about Sage:
* The goal of the project is to provide scientists a way to collect and evaluate data on site.
* This will be done by using running large scale ml programs on edge computers within the waggle nodes
* Types of nodes - Sage (any node part of SAGE project), Array of Things (cities), Wild Sage (anywhere outside), Sage Blade (Waggle node, can be used in a machine room), and Waggle (means that a node contains Waggle software stack, AI@Edge runtime libraries, and Edge docker containers)
