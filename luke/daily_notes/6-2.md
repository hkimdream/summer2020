# 6/2

- 8:45 | Asked Argonne help desk about services blocking problem, provided my IP address to them
- 9:15 | Trying to overlay FLIR images over their RGB counterpart
  - It looks like there is no way to simply place one over the other because the cameras were placed in different places
- 10:52 | Working on logging in to Bebop to pull images from the server
- 11:00 - 12:50 | Scrum daily meeting and adding stories to Jira
- 1:00 - 1:30 | Write up tutorial for new interns
- 2:00 | Looking through directory on Bebop
- 4:30 | Wrote a simple script to take the average of all the frames from a camera and for each frame, compare each individual frame with the averaged background frame. It turns out that it does not work well with the drastic light changes (which I was expecting), so maybe this approach will work better if I make an average for light and dark images separately.
