# 5/28

- 9 | Reading up on JIRA, MIRO, and the Scrum process
- 9:45 - 10:20 | Completed one training module
- 10:52 | Completed more training modules (Badge #: 310026)
- 11:31 | Working on installing Docker for Windows, if that can replace me having to use a USB Linux drive
- 12:50 - 1:07 | Lunch Break
- 1:19 | Researching Docker
  - With Docker, you can containerize services that can interact with each other
  - You can download Dockerfiles from Docker Hub that allow you to deploy packages and OS's like Linux and Python that developers can further add upon
  - You can mount a directory as a volume that gets updated as the Docker Image runs
- 2:25 | Looking at edge-plugins repo and trying to run Docker images on Windows

- 2:45 | Still trying to make the `simple-plugin` compatible with Docker for Windows, but likely to no avail
- 3:00 | Trying Docker Toolbox that uses a VirtualBox implementation
- 3:23 | Researching the different network configurations that VirtualBox supports, and why it uses host-only mode for networking
  - The virtual docker is having problems connecting to the broad internet using the standard Docker Toolbox settings
- 3:30 | Installing a Ubuntu virtualbox machine
- 4:00 | Decided the best option for a long-term Linux solution was to install it on a spare laptop hard drive which fit into my desktop
- 4:30 | Looked at Seongha's edge-plugins documentation and finished installation of Ubuntu on my desktop
- 4:45 | Setting up Docker on my Linux machine
  - Installing the Docker image for `plugin-simple` is taking some time, probably since it is being packaged with a VM
- 5:00 | Looking through the source code for the edge-plugins repo
- 5:15 | Was able to run the `simple-plugin` and ran into a `KeyError: 'credentials'`
  - The code that I need to look through is in the `plugin-simple/plugin/plugin_bin/waggle` folder
- 5:35 | Logged off
